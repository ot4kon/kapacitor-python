# kapacitor-python
Python library to programatically define kapacitor tasks (useful for integration tests or e2e tests)

Done as my side project for work (needed for Selenium tests and integration tests), so many things are not yet implemented and tests are not added, but don't worry I have time now, so I'm working on it!

If you have any suggestions, please share them with me
